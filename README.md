# MusicMatch

A dating web application that connects people based on their music taste.

## Problem
Many dating apps focus mainly on appearance and short bios, which can make it
difficult to form deeper, more meaningful connections. Music is one of the
strongest emotional and cultural connectors, yet it is often overlooked in
matching people.

## Solution
MusicMatch is a dating app that matches users based on shared music preferences.
Users select their favorite genres and artists, and the app connects them with
people who have similar music tastes, encouraging more authentic and relatable
connections.

## Features
- User sign-up and profile creation
- Music preference selection (genres and artists)
- Matching system based on shared music taste
- Clean and user-friendly interface
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Tech Stack
- HTML

## Challenges
